After a long time thinking about it, I finally commited myself to putting out a personal website.

And yes, this is actually its second version. The first one was basically a one-pager without a blog, just to have something _out there_.

My main motivation to publish this personal website is for it to serve as a personal portfolio. Right now I'm in the middle of a self-learning path: I want to become a front-end web developer first and then a full-stack one.

Therefore, I want the website to serve as a showcase for whatever I get to build, while the blog will serve as a repository of insights, lessons learned, skills gained, and so forth. Hopefully, it won't be too dry, so I might add some personal musings and ramblings, here and there.

To begin, I'll let you know I built this website using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as a static site generator and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting. On later posts I'll expand on how to use them both to create your own website.

Also, the theme you're seeing here is the wonderful ["Basically Basic"](https://github.com/mmistakes/jekyll-theme-basically-basic) by Michael Rose, a designer that goes by the alias of [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes). He creates truly amazing designs and themes, which you can check on his [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mmistakes?tab=repositories).

By the way, being a native Spanish speaker and a technical translator on my spare time, I want to have this website in both Spanish and English, so I'll be adding localized versions of all the pages and posts, eventually.

I feel there's a lack of Spanish language resources for aspiring devs (at least compared to English ones), so I want to contribute to the community by making learning more accessible for budding coders from Spanish-speaking countries.

Now let's push this thing out to production! :-)
