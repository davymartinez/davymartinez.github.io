# Welcome

This is my personal website's repository. It's built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted in [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The Jekyll theme I used is the really cool ["Basically Basic"](https://github.com/mmistakes/jekyll-theme-basically-basic) by Michael Rose a/k/a [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes) (make sure to check out his other cool themes!).

Feel free to check out the code to see what goes on to build a static website like this. However, you'll gain a better understanding by checking out the above links.

Thanks for visiting!
