This Movie Watchlist app is a handy tool that fetches data from the [Open Movie Database (OMDb) API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) to search for movies. It retrieves titles, posters, ratings, durations, genres, descriptions. All in HTML+CSS+JS, no libraries, no frameworks.

The project was part of Scrimba's Working with APIs module off the Frontend Career Path and is intended to train you with:

* API data fetching
* The `fetch()` method
* The `.then()` method
* Local storage

You can check the code out at [GitHub](https://github.com/davymartinez/Scrimba-frontend-path-projects/tree/main/mod09-working-with-apis/02-solo-project-movie-watchlist).
