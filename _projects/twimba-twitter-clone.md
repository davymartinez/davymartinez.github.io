This Twitter (now X) clone app lets you reply, load previous replies as nested tweets (_twimbs_? _x's_?) and increase the likes and retweet counters. All with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The main focus of this project was to put into practice:

* Javascript event listeners
* Datasets
* Local storage
* uuidv4

The Twimba clone is available in [Netlify](https://dm-twitter-clone.netlify.app/).

You can check the code out at [GitHub](https://github.com/davymartinez/Scrimba-frontend-path-projects/tree/main/mod05-essential-js-concepts/02-twimba).
