This project comes from the React Router section of Scrimba's FCP - Advanced React. It's a mock van rental site/app that uses React Router to handle all the different views. It includes some authentication as well (u: <b@b.com>, pw: p123).

The app uses the following tech stack and components:

* React
* React Router
* Mirage JS
* Vite

You can check the code out at [GitHub](https://github.com/davymartinez/react-vans-page).
