This is a handy password generator developed solely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's part of the "Making Websites Interactive" module off Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path.

It's fully functional and you get two passwords for the price of one: free. The purpose of this project was to learn about:

* The `Number()` constructor
* How to create random numbers using `Math.floor(Math.random())`
* The `Event` interface
* How to copy text via the Clipboard API
* CSS media queries

You can check the code out at [GitHub](https://github.com/davymartinez/Scrimba-frontend-path-projects/tree/main/mod03-making-websites-interactive/04-password-generator).
