Landing pages are important tools in online marketing. These are pages where visitors arrive specifically (and ideally) to buy, sign-up for, or download something.

This landing page is the third of five Responsive Web Design Projects from [freeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/)'s curriculum. Check it out at [Codepen](https://codepen.io/davy_martinez/pen/PXjoam).

It builds on the two previous projects, requiring the use of the same elements with the addition of:

* `header`
* `nav`
* embedded video
* CSS Flexbox
* Specific classes and id's for all key elements

Completing this project ensures you learn the basics of landing page design.
