Tenzies is a simple but fully-functional dice game, developed using React and as part of Scrimba's Frontend Career Path. Here we're using the useEffect() hook to manage side-effects created by the dice's code and game state.

The Die.jsx component code was adapted from [React CSS grid dice](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-css-grid-dice-cly4v).

This game features the following tech stack:

* React
* react-confetti
* nanoid
* Vite
