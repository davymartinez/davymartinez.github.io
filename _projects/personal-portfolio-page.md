This was the first version of the website you're seeing right now.

It started as a freeCodeCamp project and it was actually the first iteration of www.davymartinez.com. It required using elements such as:

* A welcome section (whose height should be equal to the viewport's height)
* A projects section
* Project tiles to hold each project
* A navbar that would always at the top of the viewport
* Profile links (to either GitHub or FCC)
* A media query CSS element

You can check the code out at [Codepen](https://codepen.io/davy_martinez/pen/KJPdRq).
