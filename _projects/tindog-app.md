This is a project inspired by Tinder, but for dogs. It belongs to the Next Level JS module from Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path. This is all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The main purpose of this project was to put into practice concepts such as:

* Javascript classes
* Exporting/importing modules
* The `this` keyword
* Event listeners

The app is hosted in [Netlify](https://dm-tindog-app.netlify.app/).
