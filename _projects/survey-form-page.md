This survey form page is the second of five Responsive Web Design Projects from [freeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/)'s curriculum. Check it out at [Codepen](https://codepen.io/davy_martinez/pen/dgQwOM).

It required using pretty much the same elements as the Tribute Page project, but also including a form and a text area. Therefore, to pass the tests, the project requires using:

* `id`
* `form`
* `name`, `min` and `max` attributes
* `textarea`
* `button`
* `input`

By completing this project you should learn how to deal with forms, dropdowns, checkboxes, and radio buttons -- widely used elements for data and information capture.
