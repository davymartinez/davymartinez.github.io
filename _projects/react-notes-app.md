A handy project developed as part of Scrimba's Frontend Career Path - React Basics (although it was one of the most demanding projects of the basic module.) It makes use of the react-mde component to render a fully-functional Markdown editor.

This note-taking app features the following tech stack:

* React
* Firebase
* react-mde
* Vite

The app is available in [Netlify](https://dm-notes-app.netlify.app/).

You can check the code out at [GitHub](https://github.com/davymartinez/react-notes-app).
