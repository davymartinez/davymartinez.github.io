This is the last project from Scrimba's Frontend Career Path - React Basics, but tailored only to music questions (the original course project is a general-scope quiz app.) The questions are fetched from the [OpenTrivia DB API](https://opentdb.com).

The game uses `Async/Await` promises and features the following tech stack and components:

* React
* nanoid
* he - HTML entities encoder/decoder
* ScaleLoader
* Vite

You can check the code out at [GitHub](https://github.com/davymartinez/react-musiquizzical).
