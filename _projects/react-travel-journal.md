A basic React page showing a mock-up travel journal with individual entries coming from a Data component. This is an entry-level React project, without state management, just JSX files.

This project was intended to start working with:

* React
* React components
* Mapping over data elements coming from an imported array
* Rendering those elements
* Vite

The journal is deployed in [Netlify](https://dm-react-travel-journal.netlify.app/).

You can check the code out at [GitHub](https://github.com/davymartinez/react-basics-travel-journal).
