A practical and fully-functional color scheme generator built solely with HTML+CSS+JS, fetching data from [The Color API](https://www.thecolorapi.com/). It gives you a 5-color palette and lets you choose from 8 different color scheme modes.

The project was part of Scrimba's Working with APIs module off the Frontend Career Path and is intended to give you practice with:

* API data fetching
* The `fetch()` method
* The `.then()` method
* The `<input>`, `<select>`, and `<option>` tags for drop-down menus

You can check the code out at [GitHub](https://github.com/davymartinez/Scrimba-frontend-path-projects/tree/main/mod09-working-with-apis/01-color-scheme-generator).
